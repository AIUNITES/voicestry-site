# VoiceStry Transcript — February 24, 2026 (Session 3)
## AI + Neuro Rename Verification & Housekeeping Completion

### Context
- Previous session created vrn-nerves.html (VRN & the Nervous System)
- Second session renamed to ai-neuro.html ("AI + Neuro") and updated all 13 pages — but was interrupted during final housekeeping
- This session: verified completion, fixed remaining issues, completed housekeeping

### Verification Results

#### File Rename: ✅ Complete
- `vrn-nerves.html` → `ai-neuro.html` (no stale file remains)
- No `vrn-nerves` references found in any HTML file

#### Nav Links (ai-neuro.html): ✅ All 13 Pages Confirmed
- index.html — nav + footer ✅
- vrn-method.html — nav + footer ✅
- learn.html — nav + footer ✅
- 5-gears.html — nav + footer ✅
- vocal-gym.html — nav + footer ✅
- pitch-trainer.html — nav + footer ✅
- sight-reading.html — nav + footer ✅
- voice-lab.html — nav + footer ✅
- voice-analyzer.html — nav only ✅ (interactive tool, no footer nav)
- sonic-portrait.html — nav only ✅ (interactive tool, no footer nav)
- ai-vrn.html — nav + footer ✅
- ai-neuro.html — nav (active) + footer ✅
- press.html — nav + footer ✅

### Vocal Neuro Notation (VNN) — Official Naming &amp; DMCA
- Named the neural mapping system: **Vocal Neuro Notation (VNN)**
- Mirrors "Vocal Resonance Notation (VRN)" — same naming DNA, clear sister system
- VRN = what happens. VNN = what fires to make it happen.
- **press.html**: Added full VNN feature section in Technical Brief (purple highlight box) with:
  - System description and novelty claim
  - Three VRN→VNN examples ([Zy], [Tn], [D+++])
  - Applications list (rehab, clinical, AI, pedagogy, research)
- **press.html**: IP section expanded to describe VNN as companion system
- **press.html**: Copyright line: "VNN / Vocal Neuro Notation © 2026 Tom Sans"
- **ai-neuro.html**: Full rebrand throughout:
  - Title: "Vocal Neuro Notation (VNN) — What Fires to Make You Sing"
  - Hero: introduces VRN + VNN as dual systems
  - Section headers: "Complete VRN → VNN Mapping", "VNN as Neural Training Framework"
  - Key paragraphs: "VRN is the score. VNN is the orchestra."
  - IP notice: full DMCA claim for VNN
- **UATEST_PLAN.md**: Page description updated for VNN
- **PROGRESS_LOG.md**: Full session entry for VNN naming
- VNN is the first system to map symbolic vocal production notation to its underlying neural command chains. Nobody else has built that bridge between notation and neuroscience.

### Pending
- Git commit and push (triggers auto-publish within 10 minutes)
- Optional: vocal-games.html, custom domains
