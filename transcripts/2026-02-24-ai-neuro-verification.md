# VoiceStry Transcript — February 24, 2026 (Session 3)
## AI + Neuro Rename Verification & Housekeeping Completion

### Context
- Previous session created vrn-nerves.html (VRN & the Nervous System)
- Second session renamed to ai-neuro.html ("AI + Neuro") and updated all 13 pages — but was interrupted during final housekeeping
- This session: verified completion, fixed remaining issues, completed housekeeping

### Verification Results

#### File Rename: ✅ Complete
- `vrn-nerves.html` → `ai-neuro.html` (no stale file remains)
- No `vrn-nerves` references found in any HTML file

#### Nav Links (ai-neuro.html): ✅ All 13 Pages Confirmed
- index.html — nav + footer ✅
- vrn-method.html — nav + footer ✅
- learn.html — nav + footer ✅
- 5-gears.html — nav + footer ✅
- vocal-gym.html — nav + footer ✅
- pitch-trainer.html — nav + footer ✅
- sight-reading.html — nav + footer ✅
- voice-lab.html — nav + footer ✅
- voice-analyzer.html — nav only ✅ (interactive tool, no footer nav)
- sonic-portrait.html — nav only ✅ (interactive tool, no footer nav)
- ai-vrn.html — nav + footer ✅
- ai-neuro.html — nav (active) + footer ✅
- press.html — nav + footer ✅

### Fixes Applied This Session

1. **UATEST_PLAN.md** — Nav structure section: changed "Nerves" → "AI + Neuro"
2. **sitemap.xml** — Added 3 missing pages:
   - sonic-portrait.html (created Feb 20)
   - ai-vrn.html (created Feb 24)
   - ai-neuro.html (created Feb 24)

### Files Modified
- UATEST_PLAN.md (nav label fix)
- sitemap.xml (3 new entries)

### Current Site Status
- **13 active pages** — all with consistent nav and footer
- **Nav order:** Home | VRN Method | Learn ▾ | Tools ▾ | AI + VRN | AI + Neuro | Press
- **Version:** 1.7.1
- **Ready to commit and push** for auto-publish

### DMCA / Copyright Updates
- **press.html** IP section: Expanded to explicitly name "neural mapping frameworks (including the VRN-to-Nerve mapping tables, Neural Command Chain architecture, and Vocal Neural Notation system)"
- **press.html** copyright lines: Added dedicated line "Vocal Neural Notation / VRN Neural Mapping © 2026 Tom Sans. All Rights Reserved. DMCA Protected."
- **ai-neuro.html**: Added inline IP notice section above CTA with full DMCA claim and licensing reference back to press page
- Rationale: VRN-to-nerve mapping is a novel organizational framework (nobody else has mapped vocal notation symbols to specific cranial nerves). Explicitly naming it strengthens the copyright claim beyond the general "organizational systems" language.

### Pending
- Git commit and push (triggers auto-publish within 10 minutes)
- Optional: vocal-games.html, custom domains
