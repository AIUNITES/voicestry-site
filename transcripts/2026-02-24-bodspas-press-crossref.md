# VoiceStry Cross-Reference Transcript — February 24, 2026 (Session 4)
## BodSpas Press Page — MNN Positioning, Virtual Worlds, Muscle Focus

### Context
This session primarily worked on BodSpas but has significant cross-site implications for VoiceStry:
- VNN→MNN chain prominently featured in press page
- "Who Needs MNN" mirrors "Who Needs VNN" structure from VoiceStry press page
- Virtual worlds section applies to both VNN (facial animation, lip sync) and MNN (body animation)
- Notation family reference: VRN → VNN → MNN

### What Was Created on BodSpas
- **press.html** — 5-section technical brief:
  1. What Bodybuilders Use Now (comparison table showing MNN fills all gaps)
  2. Muscle Focus: More Gains, Less Joint Damage (wrong pathway problem, joint protection table for 7 exercises)
  3. MNN for Virtual Worlds & Game Engines (current methods vs neural control layer)
  4. Who Needs MNN (6 audience cards)
  5. IP & Copyright (DMCA)

### VoiceStry Connections in BodSpas Press Page
- IP section references VNN as sister system with link to ai-neuro.html
- Footer links to VNN at VoiceStry
- "VRN → VNN → MNN" chain stated in IP section
- Virtual worlds section implicitly supports VNN use case (facial neural animation parallels body neural animation)
- "Who Needs MNN" structure mirrors "Who Needs VNN" from VoiceStry press.html

### Key New Concept: Muscle Focus = Joint Protection
- EMG research shows internal focus increases target muscle activation 20–30%+
- Neural explanation: motor cortex routing through correct vs incorrect nerve pathway
- Muscle wave control artists (BW3–BW4) have same neural precision that protects joints
- MNN formalizes this: "route through MedPec to [Pec.S], not through Axil to [Dlt.A]"
- Parallel to VNN: a singer routing through CN VII to zygomaticus = a lifter routing through MedPec to pec

### No VoiceStry Files Were Modified This Session
All changes were on BodSpas. This transcript is for cross-reference only.
