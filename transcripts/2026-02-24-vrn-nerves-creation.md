# VoiceStry Session Transcript — February 24, 2026
## Session: vrn-nerves.html creation + nav updates

### Summary
Created vrn-nerves.html — "VRN & the Nervous System" page that maps every VRN symbol to its neural command chain (cranial nerves, motor cortex, brainstem circuits). Then updated navigation across all 13 pages to include the new Nerves link.

### Work Completed

#### 1. vrn-nerves.html Created (v1.7.0)
- 11 major content sections:
  - Two Layers of Vocal Production (mechanical vs neural)
  - The Neural Command Chain (motor cortex → Broca's → basal ganglia → cerebellum → brainstem → cranial nerves → sound)
  - The 6 Cranial Nerves of Singing (CN V trigeminal, VII facial, IX glossopharyngeal, X vagus, XI accessory, XII hypoglossal)
  - The Vagus Nerve Deep Dive (RLN vs SLN branches, anatomical path, vulnerability)
  - Complete VRN → Nerve Mapping Tables (4 tables: Resonance & Placement, Vocal Fold Behavior, Breath & Airflow, Articulation & Shaping + Advanced vibrato/squillo/timbral)
  - Full Neural Trace Example (COSMOS "I SEE THE UNIVERSE!" climax — 11 simultaneous neural pathways)
  - Why This Matters (6 use-case cards: singers, teachers, clinicians, AI researchers, vocal scientists, rehabilitation)
  - The Emotional Brain & Voice (periaqueductal gray, cortical vs subcortical pathways, blending both)
  - Vagus Nerve, Singing & Wellbeing (vagal tone, parasympathetic activation, health benefits of singing)
  - VRN as Neural Training Framework (myelination, specific circuit training per VRN target)
  - Quote & CTA
- Pink/red accent theme (distinct from cyan ai-vrn and gold vrn-method)
- Hero stats: 6 cranial nerves | 100+ muscles | 75+ VRN symbols | 50ms response time
- Full VoiceStry template: webring, nav with dropdowns, footer with disclaimer and legal links

#### 2. Navigation Updates (13 pages verified)
Already had vrn-nerves.html (from prior work in this session):
- index.html ✓ (nav + footer)
- vrn-method.html ✓ (nav + footer)
- 5-gears.html ✓ (nav + footer)
- learn.html ✓ (nav + footer)
- vocal-gym.html ✓ (nav + footer)
- pitch-trainer.html ✓ (nav + footer)
- sight-reading.html ✓ (nav + footer)
- ai-vrn.html ✓ (nav + footer)

Updated this session:
- voice-lab.html ✓ (nav + footer added)
- voice-analyzer.html ✓ (nav only — no footer nav section)
- sonic-portrait.html ✓ (nav only — no footer nav section)
- press.html ✓ (nav + footer added)

New page (self-contained):
- vrn-nerves.html ✓ (created with correct nav + footer)

Nav order: Home | VRN Method | Learn ▾ | Tools ▾ | AI + VRN | Nerves | Press

#### 3. Housekeeping
- PROGRESS_LOG.md updated with February 24 entry (ai-vrn.html + vrn-nerves.html + nav updates)
- UATEST_PLAN.md updated: pages inventory (+2), version 1.7.0, navigation structure updated, version history entries added (1.6.3 + 1.7.0)
- Transcript saved to project folder

### Files Modified

### Pending
- Git commit and push to trigger auto-publish
- Verify live site after publish (https://aiunites.github.io/voicestry-site/vrn-nerves.html)
- Note: voice-analyzer.html and sonic-portrait.html have no footer nav sections — consider adding for consistency
